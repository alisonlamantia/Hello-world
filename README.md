# Hello-world

I'm a mom of two under three. I started learning computer programming through Udacity in June. 
I'm taking the intro to programming nanodegree. I really enjoy it and want to keep learning! 
My professional background is public relations. I'm interested in changing my career. 
I get up daily at about 5 a.m. to complete the lessons, quizzes and assignments.
